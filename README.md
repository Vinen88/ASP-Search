# Known Issues

## Data

Data isn't very unique there is alot of repitition. Better data could be found and models adjusted in I guess?

## Search

- Results limited to 10, will hopefully fix before hand in
- no pagnation. 
- slow start up

## choices made to make demos easier

- no persistant elastic search data. 
- data is rebuilt every time program is run
- only 2100 entries, can add more but start up times increase quite a bit
